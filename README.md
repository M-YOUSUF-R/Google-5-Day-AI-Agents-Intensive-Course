# Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course
## Description:
This 5-day online course was crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. You’ll learn the core components – models, tools, orchestration, memory and evaluation. Finally, you’ll discover how agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems.

Each day blends conceptual deep dives with hands-on examples, codelabs, and live discussions. By the end, you’ll be ready to build, evaluate, and deploy agents that solve real-world problems.

## Running Process:
- rename `.env_example` to `.env`
- inside `.env`,put your `gemini-api-key` from [gemini-api-key](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)
Example:
    ```shell
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```
- Go through all the `Day-x` ; `x = 1,2,3,..` folders and run `main.py` file
    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
